Other events from our affiliates:
* Portland Nursery's 27th annual <a href="http://www.portlandnursery.com/events/appletasting.shtml">apple tasting festival</a>. This is the best place to find laurel(???) and jenndolan(???) during the day , and to eat strudel. Probably best if you don't attempt to drive; parking will be worse than downtown.

> The [Columbus Day Storm of 1962](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus_Day_Storm_of_1962) 
> (otherwise known as the Big Blow) was an extratropical wave cyclone that ranked among the most 
> intense to strike the United States Pacific Northwest since at least 1948, likely since the 
> January 9, 1880, "Great Gale" and snowstorm. On a larger scale, the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 is 
> a contender for the title of most powerful extratropical cyclone recorded in the U.S. in the 20th 
> century; with respect to wind velocity, it is unmatched by the March 1993 "Storm of the Century" 
> and the "1991 Halloween Northeaster" (aka "The Perfect Storm"). In the eastern United States, only 
> hurricanes of Category 3 or higher have brought winds of the magnitude witnessed in Oregon and
